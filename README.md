### Description

A while ago I posted some source code which allowed the loading of animated gifs into directx. A while later I wrote some code which allowed alpha blending in directx. Today, I rewrote the alpha blending code to use getlockedarray instead of pixel, which quite significantly sped the alpha blending up, and combined these 2 codes into 1. I average around 26fps without alphablending, and 24-25 with, which I think is a pretty good number, given that this is 100% vb :).

If anyone find any problems or has any ideas, feel free to email me.
